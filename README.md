# fhirformjs

## About

This is an npm module to convert a FHIR Questionnaire to jsonForm for automatic form rendering. This is still work in progress and a helping hand will be highly appreciated. The package has two modules: *fhirformjs*  converting items in a Questionnaire to *schema, ui and data* elements. *fhirformResp* adds the response converting it into a FHIR *QuestionnaireResponse* resource that can be submitted to any FHIR server.

## Installation
This has not been added to npm yet. Use github for now as below:
