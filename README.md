# fhirformjs

## About

This is an npm module to convert a FHIR Questionnaire to jsonForm for automatic form rendering. This is still work in progress and a helping hand will be highly appreciated. The package has two modules: _fhirformjs_  converting items in a Questionnaire to _schema, ui and data_ elements. _fhirformResp_ adds the response converting it into a FHIR _QuestionnaireResponse_ resource that can be submitted to any FHIR server.

## Installation
